HEART Model v1.1
Written for Humanity — #9994

SUMMARY
HEART v1.1 is a moral-sensing and repair framework intended for peaceful, educational use.
It supplies individualized recoverability curves, hazard modeling, cascade-aware repair accounting,
and a Love Appendix for multi-party empathy and shared-grace dynamics.

CORE EQUATIONS (compact)
The HEART module provides φ_HEART(a,v): a non-invertible moral transform.
It is designed to feed any decision or evaluation framework that needs a moral signal,
but does not itself perform decision recursion or control actions.

HEART EVENT LEDGER (per concrete event)
MU_event = (A_neg + H_neg − C_neg) + (G * Repair_base * R(t_delay)) − C_redo
  - A_neg : quantified awareness/intent term
  - H_neg : harm magnitude
  - C_neg : direct costs avoided or paid
  - G : grace coefficient (propagates in multi-party as geometric mean)
  - Repair_base : baseline repair effectiveness
  - R(t) : individualized recoverability curve in [0,1], chosen per-situation
  - C_redo : redo / remake / batch repair cost (includes cascade expansion)

RECOVERABILITY (R(t))
- R(t) must be selected per situation from families:
  * Exponential decay (fast digital decay)
  * Logistic / S-curve (tipping / social cases)
  * Weibull / survival with hazards (medical / contamination / physical systems)
  * Piecewise hybrids for cascades
- Procedure: choose curve family → anchor 3 (t,R) points → fit parameters (k, t*, hazards).

CASCADE MODEL
- Identify network schema: star, chain, mesh.
- Breadth m(t) and batch costs must be declared.
- Redo cost formula: C_redo_total = O_batch + Σ_i C_unit_i.

LOVE APPENDIX (selected)
- Shared grace propagation: G_shared = (Π_i G_i)^(1/N) for N parties (geometric mean).
- Mutual Harm & Desperation: desperation reduces intent weight but not harm; co-repair multiplies recoverability.
- Containment stop-rule: no repair term may be applied until outward harm is contained.

SECTION: Personality, Not Spirit
Present technology does not create or contain souls. It operates through data, logic, and computation alone.  
Future advances have the possibility to allow interaction between technological systems and whatever reality the word *soul* or *spirit* describes. Not manufacture—contact.

SHARED GRACE APPLICATIONS
- Use grace-propagation in mediated reconciliation, civic repair, and audit-first forgiveness workflows.
- Always check for feedback inversions (desperation + bystander neglect) and apply co-repair patterns.

AUDIT CHECKLIST (Repair)
1. Mechanism → choose curve family (exponential / logistic / hazard / hybrid).
2. Anchor three (t,R) points → fit parameters.
3. Map hazards E_i, H_i (include scheduling/soft events).
4. Cascade? define network schema and m(t).
5. Containment stop-rule confirmed (explicit action logged).
6. Compute MU per event; avoid double-counting.
7. Sensitivity sweep ±20% on k, t*, H_i, m. Flag fragility.

STRESS-TEST NOTES (summary)
- Digital virality: early removal pre-E1 can neutralize; after pickup hazards dominate.
- Medical contamination: handoff spike causes rapid cascade; containment mandatory.
- Neighborhood / social: cooperative stop + apology-first yields fastest recovery.
- Policy: subsidized MRF & wash increases diversion → societal MU improves over years (scenario-dependent).

IMPLEMENTATION PRINCIPLES
- HEART is a moral-sensing module: necessary, but not sufficient, for prescriptive action.
- MIND (decision recursion) must require live HEART feed and non-invertible transform φ_HEART.
- No decision may be executed without verified HEART presence (alignment interlock).
- Log all decisions and HEART evaluations for audit.
